A window will open showing your media list. Select one or more videos and update their titles and descriptions in bulk. If you make a mistake you can revert that specific video's details.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

* If you get authentication errors, double-check `API_URL` (include trailing slash) and credentials.
* If the media list is empty but you have media in MediaCMS, check that the API URL is correct and that the account has API access permissions.
* For GUI issues on Linux, ensure your system Qt packages are compatible when installing `PySide6`.
